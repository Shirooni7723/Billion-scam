          <h2>What is Billions Network?</h2>
          <p>
            Billions Network is a Web3 project that has been building
            significant hype in the crypto community. With a Token Generation
            Event (TGE) on the horizon and promises of airdrops to loyal
            community members, thousands of users have been grinding daily to
            secure their position.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project operates a Discord server where members can earn roles
            based on their activity and contribution. The most prestigious role?
            The <strong>"Super OG" (SOG)</strong> role — a badge of honor that
            supposedly signifies weeks of dedicated effort, consistent
            engagement, and genuine community building.
          </p>
          <p>Or at least, that's what it's supposed to mean.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- The Accusation -->
        <section class="section" id="accusation">
          <h2>The Man Behind the Scam: @jgonzalezferrer</h2>
          <p>
            Meet <strong>Javi</strong> (Twitter:
            <a
              href="https://twitter.com/jgonzalezferrer"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >@jgonzalezferrer</a
            >), the Head of Community at Billions Network. As the person
            responsible for assigning roles in the Discord server, he holds
            significant power over who gets rewarded and who doesn't.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's the thing — Javi isn't just assigning roles based on
            merit. He's running a fucking side business.
          </p>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>The Scheme</h3>
            <p>
              Javi has opened a Twitter subscription service priced at
              approximately <strong>410-500 INR (roughly $5 USD)</strong>. Users
              who subscribe to his Twitter and post some basic content about
              Billions Network are getting the SOG role handed to them — no
              questions asked, no actual work required.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, legitimate members who have been grinding for
            <strong>months</strong> — engaging in conversations, creating
            content, building the community — are left wondering why random
            accounts with barely any Discord activity are getting the same
            recognition.

            <strong>weeks of consistent engagement</strong>. Look at these
